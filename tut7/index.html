<h1>JavaScript Event</h1>
<p>In JavaScript, an event refers to an action or occurrence that happens in the browser, 
typically as a result of user interaction or other external factors. Events can be 
triggered by actions such as clicking a button, typing on the keyboard, moving the mouse, 
or loading a webpage.</p>
<h3>Common Event Types:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mouse events: click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove, mouseover, mouseout</li>
<li>Keyboard events: keydown, keyup, keypress</li>
<li>Form events: submit, focus, blur, change</li>
<li>Window events: load, resize, scroll</li>
</ul>
<h4>Note: Events in JavaScript allow developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages 
by responding to user actions or other changes in the environment.</h4>
<button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>
<script>
    // Getting the button element
    const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    // Adding an event listener for the click event
    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
      alert("Button clicked!");
    });
</script>
